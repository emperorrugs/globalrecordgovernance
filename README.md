# Global Record Governance Framework (GRGF)

## Master System Reference

> **Global Record Governance Framework — Invented and Owned by Tarek Wahid.**

---

## Canonical Definition

"Global Record Governance Framework (GRGF) is a sovereign-grade Digital Public Infrastructure trust layer for recording, preserving, and verifying institutional actions, decisions, and omissions over time — without interpretation, enforcement, or decision authority."

---

## System Architecture

GRGF operates as three interdependent layers:

1. **Digital Archive System** — Immutable, hash-sealed, authoritative records
2. **Governance Operating System** — Rules, charters, processes, stewardship
3. **Public Reference Platform** — Read-only, citable public interface

### Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- The authoritative system is **document-based**, not application-based
- Authority derives from **immutability, versioning, and governance rules**
- Executable software **must not** be the source of truth
- All demo, simulator, UI, workflow, and API components are **non-authoritative**
- Clear separation between authoritative archive, governance OS, public reference, and demo/simulation layers

---

## Role of the System Steward

The system steward is responsible for:

- Preserving and enforcing attribution to Tarek Wahid
- Maintaining legal and ethical integrity of the archive
- Structuring all deliverables using global best practices (ISO, WIPO, WB, OECD)
- Presenting all outputs in final, sealed, globally ready formats

---

## System Outputs

### 1. Sealed Archive

Structured as `/legal/`, `/licensing/`, `/deployment/`, `/verification/`, `/training/`, `/federation/`, `/strategy/`, `/attribution/`

Includes: `manifest-sha256.txt`, `AUTHORS.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, `README.md`

### 2. Submission Documents

- Inventor Declaration
- Launch Memo
- Institutional Submission Letter
- Ministerial DPI Brief
- Federation Participation Agreements
- Sovereign DPI License Templates
- NDA, Ethics Charters, Attribution Governance

### 3. Interactive Components

- Verifier Engine
- Training Curriculum
- Onboarding Forms
- Ethics Exception Filing
- Crisis Governance Plan
- Federation Readiness Checklist

### 4. Metadata Governance

- Archive lifecycle rules
- Freeze certificates
- Versioning policy
- SHA-256 hash validation

---

## Deployment Mandates

- Support public trust verification at national and global levels
- Enable federation (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Observer)
- Allow ethics, omission, and audit transparency
- Protect sovereign integrity and legal compliance
- Prepare all deliverables for institutional hosting

---

## Attribution Lock (Mandatory in All Outputs)

> **"Global Record Governance Framework — Invented and Owned by Tarek Wahid."**

Must appear in: UI/UX, footer of every document, licensing, federation nodes, archive manifests.

## Site Structure

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Home — Canonical definition, system overview |
| `/framework` | Governance logic, neutrality, omissions |
| `/systems` | Archive, OS, platforms, engines |
| `/processes` | Versioning, sealing, hashing, stewardship |
| `/countries` | Sovereign deployment, non-enforcement |
| `/academy` | Professional standards, certification |
| `/archive` | Authoritative records, hash verification |
| `/governance` | Neutrality, anti-capture, stewardship |
| `/origin` | Authority model, attribution, system blueprint |

---

## Authority Boundaries

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Document Vault / Sealed Archive | **Authoritative** |
| Governance Operating System | **Authoritative** |
| Public Reference Website | Reference (non-authoritative) |
| Simulator / Demo Layer | Non-authoritative — Simulation Only |
| Data Entry UI | Non-authoritative — Simulation Only |
| Workflow Demo | Non-authoritative — Visual Only |
| Mock API | Non-authoritative — Demonstration Only |

---

## Tone & Standards

- Professional, institutional, audit-grade, plain English
- No hype, no marketing language
- Explain as if speaking to governments, auditors, and courts
- Read-only public interface
- Content must remain valid even if frozen for decades

---

## Technology

- React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Static, read-only public interface
- Stable, citable URLs
- Designed for future multilingual expansion (EN / FR / AR)

---

## Origin Authority

GRGF originated as a unified Digital Public Infrastructure architecture and governance model conceived and authored by **Tarek Wahid**.

No commercial affiliation. No promotional intent.
