        <h1>Global Record Governance Framework</h1>
        <p><strong>Independent Digital Public Infrastructure Standards & Recognition Authority</strong></p>
        <p>Global Record Governance Framework (GRGF) is a sovereign-grade Digital Public Infrastructure trust layer for recording, preserving, and verifying institutional actions, decisions, and omissions over time — without interpretation, enforcement, or decision authority.</p>

        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <p>GRGF operates a six-layer deterministic architecture: Event Capture &amp; Normalization, Policy Decision Engine, Evidence Backbone (append-only), Cryptographic Anchoring (SHA-256/512), Verification API, and Federation &amp; Interoperability. Data flows one direction — no reverse path, no update operations, no deletion capability.</p>

        <h2>Recognition Framework</h2>
        <p>Three-tier institutional certification: Level I (Foundational DPI Compliance), Level II (Verified Governance Alignment), Level III (Institutional-Grade Certified DPI). Structured accreditation pathway involving technical validation, security review, and procedural audit.</p>

        <h2>Transparency &amp; Governance</h2>
        <p>Governed by six Charter Principles: Neutrality, Verifiability, Integrity, Transparency, Accountability, and Interoperability. Five Anti-Capture Clauses (AC-01–05) prevent vendor, governmental, or institutional capture. Zero Trust architecture with no centralized override.</p>

        <h2>Membership &amp; Advisory</h2>
        <p>Multi-tier institutional engagement: Observer, Associate, and Partner membership levels. Governance Board, Standards Committee, Advisory Council, and Technical Review Committee ensure consensus-driven international stewardship.</p>

        <h2>Digital Archive</h2>
        <p>Institutional-grade repository with 68+ policy and technical documents across Executive, Architecture, Security, Governance, Deployment, Impact &amp; ROI, Compliance, and Pilot categories. SHA-256 hash verification for document integrity.</p>

        <h2>Standards &amp; Compliance</h2>
        <p>Aligned with ISO 27001 (Information Security), ISO 42001 (AI Management), ISO 37000 (Governance), ISO 15489 (Records Management), OECD Privacy Guidelines, GDPR, World Bank DPI Guidelines, and OECD AI Principles. Unified cross-reference compliance matrix available.</p>

        <h2>International Alignment</h2>
        <p>Positioned as Layer 3 (Governance Integrity Registry) within the national DPI stack, aligned with OECD Policy Paper No. 68, UN SDG 16, World Bank GTMI, G20 DPI Framework, ITU-T X.509/X.1252, and UNESCO ROAM-X standards.</p>

        <h2>Institutional Access</h2>
        <p>Controlled Distribution Protocol with four classification levels: Public, Institutional Review, NDA Required, Restricted Deployment. Contact: contact@globalrecordgovernance.com</p>
